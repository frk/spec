How to check the state of the app after a specific request was executed? 


1. a chain of requests that allows a request in the chain to check if a previous
	request produced the expected change.

2. similar to 1., a set of pre and post requests that can be executed concurrently
	before (pre) and after (post) the request under test.

3. closure pre and post hooks that could be executed pre and post the request under test.
	(here it's more difficult to provide access to the same resources as those that
	the handler under test is using...)

Or is this a fool's errand? Instead of doing it this way each of the individual
data endpoints that need to be tested in the after hooks should be tested separately
by feeding it data that is diverse enough to test each possible case!
